im failing to do something consistently with the same energy. 
this is not me so im trying to bring the old me back.
vedu lamba and casey neistat have one thing in common - they both vlogged and recorded their life *every day* for 700 days!!!


every day. day in and day out they put in the work. to put out one video every. single. day. 

i need that. so im going to be blogging almost every day. math, physics, cs and quant fin. 

plan: 

1. **mlu explain** for all things ML visually explained.
2. **seeing theory by brown uni** for starting out w probability and statistics
3. **stats in python** - [Python for Probability and Statistics](https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/landingpage.html)
4. and [Foundations of Probability](https://prob-stat-python.github.io/textbook/)
5. trading with futures and options in detail with visualization

and more!

stay tuned.
